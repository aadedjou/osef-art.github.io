            <p>
                Hi there ! I'm really glad you reached my portfolio/website. <br>
                My name is Adam, I'm 20 and really into multimedia/developping. <br> <br>
                I've been drawing since I'm a kid, mostly stickmen and cartoonish characters.
                I was so into my universe that I made cartoons of my characters, with a lore
                and a bunch of adventures. <br>
                When I was in school, I was sharing my creations with a few friends who had quite
                similar interests. One of them made me discovered a site named stickpage.com, and
                I was stunned seeing a lot of people, like me, liked to share their nerdy universe
                with animations and games. I would spend hours discovering new animations, new animators
                and new universes. <br>
                Around 2013, I accidently downloaded on the Play Store a stickman-animating app,
                that I enjoyed and adopted really quickly. At first I only shared my creations with
                my friends, but after a few months I decided to put my work on a YouTube channel. <br>
                I was awful at this, but I met a real lot of people that supported me and liked
                my universe. This really really helped me improve over the years, making me discover
                new softwares, new techniques and an amazing community. <br><br>
                Around my entrance in college, I had to put a huge pause in animating to focus on my
                studies. Plus, the lack of material (graphic tablet, decent computer) was blocking me 
                in my improvement. <br>
                But hopefully, I started computer engeneering studies that taught me web designing,
                and software developping. With my skills in animating and my knowledge in Java, C++,
                etc. I've developped on my own a bunch of little games I've always dreamt about. <br>

                One of my biggest wishes is that my creations reach the most people possible. I want
                my stuff to inspire people like other animators inspired me by the past.
                If my style and universe can be recognized among other creations, I would consider
                my goal acomplished. :D
